üö® ADDITIONAL NOTES & CORRECTIONS (FROM SCREEN REVIEW)

üîç Identified issues:
	‚Ä¢	Sidebar glass styling:
	‚Ä¢	Some screenshots show a sidebar that is more of a flat matte dark fill ‚Äî needs to be a true glass with rgba(30,30,30,0.5) and backdrop-blur(10px).
	‚Ä¢	Top header bar:
	‚Ä¢	Still using solid gold fills in some places. This violates the luxury minimal style. Should be transparent / pure with thin gold underline only.
	‚Ä¢	Communication templates:
	‚Ä¢	Using bright tinted card fills (green, pink, blue). This breaks the minimalism rule ‚Äî these must also be glass containers with maybe a small colored icon or a 3px left border. The text inside can have green/red/blue labels but the card itself must remain glass.

‚úÖ Enforcement:
	‚Ä¢	All backgrounds that aren‚Äôt explicitly sidebars/cards must be pure #FFFFFF (light) or #121212 (dark).
	‚Ä¢	Absolutely no component should have a solid gold or purple fill.
	‚Ä¢	Every container should apply the consistent glass + border radius + shadow style to maintain that iOS 18 look.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Done.
This is now your clean, enforced, contradiction-free spec, with explicit call-outs to fix sidebar, header bars, and template cards to truly match the ultra-luxury, airy iOS 18 design we originally visualized.

‚∏ª

üí¨ If you want, I can now generate a precise file-by-file implementation checklist for your developers (or your Replit agent), telling exactly:
	‚Ä¢	what lines or sections to look for,
	‚Ä¢	what variables to adjust,
	‚Ä¢	what Tailwind theme entries to confirm.
