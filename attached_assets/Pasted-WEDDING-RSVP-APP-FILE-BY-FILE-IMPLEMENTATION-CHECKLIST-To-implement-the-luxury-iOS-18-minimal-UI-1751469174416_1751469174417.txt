WEDDING RSVP APP - FILE BY FILE IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

(To implement the luxury iOS 18 minimal UI spec exactly)

‚∏ª

üìÅ 1. client/src/index.css

This is your master styling file.
It controls:
	‚Ä¢	Global background
	‚Ä¢	Color variables
	‚Ä¢	Typography
	‚Ä¢	Glassmorphism styles
	‚Ä¢	Component effects like hover & focus

What to ensure in this file:
	‚Ä¢	Set global body background:
	‚Ä¢	#FFFFFF in light mode
	‚Ä¢	#121212 in dark mode
	‚Ä¢	Use CSS variables to define the design tokens:
	‚Ä¢	--color-text-primary: #111111;
	‚Ä¢	--color-text-secondary: #666666;
	‚Ä¢	--color-text-primary-dark: #FDFDFD;
	‚Ä¢	--color-text-secondary-dark: #AAAAAA;
	‚Ä¢	--color-purple: #5E239D;
	‚Ä¢	--color-gold: #BFA76F;
	‚Ä¢	--color-glass-light: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);
	‚Ä¢	--color-glass-dark: rgba(30,30,30,0.5);
	‚Ä¢	--color-border-light: rgba(0,0,0,0.06);
	‚Ä¢	--color-border-dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
	‚Ä¢	Create a .glass class to apply to all cards, panels, sidebars, wizard steps:
	‚Ä¢	Light mode: background rgba(255,255,255,0.6) + backdrop-filter: blur(12px)
	‚Ä¢	Dark mode: background rgba(30,30,30,0.5) + backdrop-filter: blur(10px)
	‚Ä¢	Soft border + subtle shadow.
	‚Ä¢	Make sure hover effect on .glass:
	‚Ä¢	transform: scale(1.02)
	‚Ä¢	box-shadow changes to 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
	‚Ä¢	All text uses font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
	‚Ä¢	For couple names or headings where needed, use .decorative-text with 'Cormorant Garamond', serif.
	‚Ä¢	All focus rings use:
	‚Ä¢	outline: 2px solid #5E239D;
	‚Ä¢	outline-offset: 2px;
	‚Ä¢	No background fill of purple or gold anywhere (these only used on borders, progress fills, logo text).

‚∏ª

üìÅ 2. tailwind.config.ts

This configures how Tailwind generates classes that link to your design system.

What to ensure in this file:
	‚Ä¢	Extend colors to map your variables, e.g.:
	‚Ä¢	primary: '#5E239D'
	‚Ä¢	gold: '#BFA76F'
	‚Ä¢	glassLight: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.6)'
	‚Ä¢	glassDark: 'rgba(30,30,30,0.5)'
	‚Ä¢	textPrimary: '#111111'
	‚Ä¢	textSecondary: '#666666'
	‚Ä¢	Set global border radius to 0.75rem (12px) for consistency across all elements.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure Inter is the default sans font.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure transitions are smooth 0.3s ease for transforms & shadows.

‚∏ª

üìÅ 3. theme.json

This sets your theme system defaults.

What to ensure here:
	‚Ä¢	primary color set to #5E239D (but used only for tiny accents).
	‚Ä¢	variant is professional.
	‚Ä¢	radius is 0.75.

‚∏ª

üìÅ 4. Component files (client/src/components/*)

This includes your layout (dashboard-layout, sidebar, header) and UI components (buttons, forms, tables).

What to ensure here:
	‚Ä¢	All div containers for cards, wizards, panels, etc. use .glass class or Tailwind that maps to glass (like bg-glassLight + backdrop-blur).
	‚Ä¢	Sidebar:
	‚Ä¢	Has a glass background.
	‚Ä¢	Active item shows 3px left border in purple (#5E239D).
	‚Ä¢	Text in sidebar is always primary text color.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons:
	‚Ä¢	Transparent glass look with a subtle border.
	‚Ä¢	Scale to 1.02 on hover, shadow deepens.
	‚Ä¢	On focus, show purple ring.
	‚Ä¢	Form inputs:
	‚Ä¢	Glass background.
	‚Ä¢	On focus, show 3px left border in purple.
	‚Ä¢	Progress bars:
	‚Ä¢	Light gray or white background with fill in #5E239D.
	‚Ä¢	Status pills (like confirmed/declined):
	‚Ä¢	Green/red/yellow, NOT purple/gold.
	‚Ä¢	Have glass background.
	‚Ä¢	Tables:
	‚Ä¢	Glass background.
	‚Ä¢	Row hover effect: slight background darken rgba(0,0,0,0.01).

‚ö†Ô∏è ADDITIONAL NOTES (UI/UX CONTRADICTIONS SPOTTED)

After critically reviewing the screenshots vs the spec:
	‚Ä¢	Some communication template cards do NOT appear to have the glass effect, they look like flat solid white or black boxes.
	‚Ä¢	They must also have backdrop-blur, semi-transparent glass backgrounds, consistent border radius & shadow.
	‚Ä¢	Some dashboard card backgrounds & progress cards were showing odd solid fills or wrong shadows (seen in your brownish screenshots).
	‚Ä¢	They should be semi-transparent glass, never fully solid with that muddy brown.
	‚Ä¢	The sidebar sometimes does NOT look like it has a glass surface, check that it consistently uses .glass or Tailwind equivalent.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Done:
This text now serves as your single source of truth.

When you say:

‚ÄúImplement this exactly across index.css, tailwind.config.ts, theme.json, and all component files.‚Äù
‚Äî it will enforce this luxury minimal iOS 18 design, removing all hard fills, ensuring glass, soft shadows, and correct use of purple/gold accents.
