Fix All UI Issues: Complete Implementation

Replit Agent, your task is to fix and finalize the UI of my Indian Wedding RSVP Platform across the entire application, once and for all.
The app must exactly match the design principles, colors, typography, hover and active states shown in my uploaded screenshots and references.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Core UI Goals:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sidebar & Navigation
	‚Ä¢	Ensure consistent styling in light and dark modes.
	‚Ä¢	Sidebar hover: text and icon colors must remain readable (no white-on-black that disappears).
	‚Ä¢	Active sidebar items must be highlighted with a clear background or side border.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain elegant spacing between icons and text.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Typography
	‚Ä¢	Headings: Cormorant Garamond, large and slightly decorative.
	‚Ä¢	Body / UI text: Inter for clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure consistent font weights and letter spacing as per my design references.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Colors & Brand Palette
	‚Ä¢	Use brand accent colors: purple, gold, soft yellow.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid default grays, Bootstrap blues, or any off-brand colors.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons, progress bars, tags should pull from this palette.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Dark & Light Mode
	‚Ä¢	Light mode: soft whites with brand accent colors.
	‚Ä¢	Dark mode: elegant near-black backgrounds, subtle purples, with text and icons maintaining legibility.
	‚Ä¢	Hover & active states must adjust appropriately in dark mode (light overlays on dark bg, not disappearing).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Components & Screens
	‚Ä¢	Cards & panels: consistent corner radius, shadows, hover elevation.
	‚Ä¢	Tables: proper row height, header weight, alternating row shading.
	‚Ä¢	Charts: align to brand colors (purple for RSVP progress).
	‚Ä¢	Multi-step wizards: sidebar step indicators matching our brand styles.
	‚Ä¢	Upcoming Tasks & RSVP Activity: follow the dashboard card style exactly.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Buttons & Inputs
	‚Ä¢	Primary buttons: use purple with soft hover transitions.
	‚Ä¢	Secondary buttons: muted outlines or subtle backgrounds.
	‚Ä¢	Focus states: clear outline or subtle shadow glow matching brand color.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Accessibility & Contrast
	‚Ä¢	Ensure text & icons meet WCAG AA contrast guidelines in both themes.
	‚Ä¢	Use appropriate color contrast ratios for body text, table text, and sidebar links.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Spacing & Alignment
	‚Ä¢	All spacing, padding, margins should be consistent (use 4, 8, 12, 16px scale).
	‚Ä¢	Align all sidebar icons & text precisely.
	‚Ä¢	Keep consistent spacing between dashboard cards, tables, wizards.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile & Responsive
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that sidebar collapses or becomes a drawer on small screens.
	‚Ä¢	Text scales correctly without breaking layout.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain tap-friendly button sizes.

üî• Bonus:
	‚Ä¢	Use subtle transitions for hover and step changes to make the UX feel polished.

‚∏ª

üñºÔ∏è Design References:
	‚Ä¢	Rely heavily on the screenshots & UI references I uploaded earlier (light + dark mode examples).
	‚Ä¢	These represent the final intended look, use them as the baseline.

‚∏ª

üìù Summary Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Implement all these UI improvements in one comprehensive pass, covering the entire application.
	‚Ä¢	When done, give me a short report summarizing what was fixed or improved, so I can verify.

‚úÖ This is the final polish phase. Complete all visual adjustments at once without needing small iterative requests.
