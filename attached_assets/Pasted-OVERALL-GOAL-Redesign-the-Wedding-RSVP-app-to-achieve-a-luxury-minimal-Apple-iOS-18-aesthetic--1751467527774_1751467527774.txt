FILE-BY-FILE IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

index.css:
	•	Define these colors as :root variables, including media query for dark mode.
	•	Apply to:
	•	body with proper background & text colors
	•	.card, .wizard-step, .dashboard-panel, .sidebar with:
background: var(–color-surface);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
border-radius: 0.75rem;
border: 1px solid var(–color-border);
transition: all 0.3s ease;
	•	On hover, scale to 1.02 and deepen shadow.
	•	Add subtle radial overlay on dark cards for depth.
	•	Use Inter for all UI text.

tailwind.config.ts:
	•	Extend theme to map these CSS variables:
primary -> var(–color-accent-purple)
accent -> var(–color-accent-gold)
background, surface, text.primary, text.secondary, border from variables.
	•	Default fontFamily.sans to Inter.
	•	Set default borderRadius to 0.75rem.
	•	Add custom shadow glass as 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15).

theme.json (for shadcn):
	•	Set:
{
“variant”: “professional”,
“primary”: “#5E239D”,
“radius”: 0.75,
“appearance”: “light”
}

⸻

COMPONENT BEHAVIOR RULES
	•	Sidebar:
	•	Glass style, dark or light depending on mode.
	•	Active link gets thin 3px left border in purple.
	•	Dashboard stat cards (Confirmed, Declined, Awaiting, Total Guests):
	•	Same glass style.
	•	Hover: no bright background fills. Instead, slight scale + deeper shadow.
	•	Tiny indicators:
	•	Progress fills, active steps, small underlines use purple.
	•	Icon strokes, under major headings use gold.
	•	Form inputs & buttons:
	•	Focus ring or subtle glow in purple, no bright fills.
	•	Tables & RSVP charts:
	•	Use glass panels, subtle gold or purple on selected rows or hover lines.

⸻

FINAL POLISH
	•	Maintain large spacing & minimal text for luxury Apple feel.
	•	All transitions smooth: 0.3s ease.
	•	Never use purple or gold as full background fills — only small interactive or branding elements.

⸻

TASK SUMMARY
	•	Completely rewrite index.css, tailwind.config.ts and theme.json to implement this design system.
	•	Ensure light/dark mode adapts via prefers-color-scheme.
	•	Preserve existing fade/scale animations.
	•	Use Inter for all text, Cormorant only if needed for large hero headings.
	•	Maintain your existing RSVP flow, logic, and structure — only update visuals.

This will result in an RSVP app that feels like an Apple iOS 18 native dashboard, with glass surfaces, luxury spacing, subtle shadows, and minimal gold & purple accents. Please implement these specs exactly.
