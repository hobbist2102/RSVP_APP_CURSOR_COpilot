## Technical Debt & Refactoring Areas
1. **Event Assignment System**: Create proper planner-to-event assignment system with database table and UI
2. **Route organization**: Consolidate and organize route handlers by feature
3. **Type safety**: Enhance TypeScript types across the application (fix any[] types in guest routes)
4. **Test coverage**: Implement unit and integration tests
5. **Error handling**: Standardize error handling and user feedback
6. **Code modularization**: Refactor to more modular components and services
7. **Performance optimization**: Address memory usage in animation rendering
8. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG standards
9. **Session management**: Review and optimize cookie settings for production security

## Development Best Practices
To ensure consistent and high-quality development:

1. **Consistent code style**: Use ESLint and Prettier with strict rules
2. **Component-based approach**: Build reusable, well-documented components
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works before adding advanced features
4. **Mobile-first design**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
5. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript strictly with no implicit any types
6. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
7. **Documentation**: Document APIs, components, and complex processes
8. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for all user interfaces
9. **Performance**: Regularly audit and optimize performance
10. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for auth and data access

## Implementation Priorities
To ensure efficient development that aligns with business needs:

1. **Event Assignment System**: Implement proper event-to-planner assignment system (next priority)
2. **RSVP communication flow**: Complete email integration for RSVP notifications and followups
3. **Event Setup Wizard**: Finish the guided setup flow for new event creation
4. **Guest management enhancements**: Improve relationship mapping and guest grouping
5. **Accommodation tracking**: Implement hotel and travel management
6. **Reporting**: Build comprehensive reporting tools for decision-making
7. **Advanced features**: Add enhancements once core functionality is stable

## Current Progress (Updated May 19, 2025)

In our most recent development sprint, we've accomplished the following:

1. **Authentication System**
   - Fixed session persistence issues for more reliable user authentication
   - Enhanced cookie management to ensure users stay logged in consistently
   - Improved session storage configuration for better performance

2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
   - Implemented proper role-based access control for events
   - Ensured admins can see all events while couples see only their own events
   - Documentation added for future event assignment system for wedding planners

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Made progress on memory usage reduction for animation rendering
   - Identified TypeScript type issues in guest management endpoints for future fixes

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. Implement proper event assignment system for wedding planners
2. Fix TypeScript typing issues in guest management routes
3. Complete email integration for the RSVP flow
4. Finalize the event setup wizard guided flow

## Future Considerations
- Mobile application for on-the-go management
- Advanced AI for guest suggestions and planning
- Integration with calendar and collaboration tools
- Multi-language support for international weddings
- Payment integration for guest contributions or vendor payments
- Advanced analytics and predictive modeling

By following this roadmap and consistently checking it against the detailed user flows, the development process will be more structured, efficient, and aligned with actual user needs.
