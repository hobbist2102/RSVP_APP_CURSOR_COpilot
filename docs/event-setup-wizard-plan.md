## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Wizard Framework and Database Structure
- Create base UI components for the wizard (navigation, progress tracking)
- Implement database schema for storing wizard progress
- Build the navigation and state management system
- Create skeleton pages for all wizard sections
- Implement "save & continue" and "skip section" functionality

### Phase 2: Data Connections
- Connect existing data models to wizard sections
- Implement data validation for each step
- Create APIs for saving partial configuration
- Build progress tracking and completion indicators
- Implement data prefetching for wizard sections

### Phase 3: Feature Integration
- Migrate existing configuration screens to wizard format
- Ensure all current functionality is preserved
- Implement new features within wizard framework
- Add placeholders for WhatsApp and AI integration
- Create upgrade paths for future features

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Test wizard flow with various use cases
- Ensure data consistency across sections
- Optimize user experience and navigation
- Document wizard architecture for future expansion
- Create comprehensive onboarding guide
3. Develop data validation for each step
4. Create comprehensive event status tracking

### Phase 3: Refactoring Existing Features
1. Modify hotel management to reference wizard data
2. Adapt accommodation system to use wizard-defined inventory
3. Refactor transport module to utilize predefined transport options
4. Update RSVP module to reference wizard configuration
5. Connect email system to wizard-defined templates and settings

### Phase 4: UI/UX Streamlining
1. Replace redundant setup pages with wizard links
2. Add quick-edit options from management pages
3. Improve navigation between wizard and management interfaces
4. Add dashboard indicators for incomplete setup sections

## Required Changes to Transport Module

Current transport implementation requires significant changes:

1. **Transport Options Definition:**
   - Move from creating individual transport groups to defining available fleet
   - Predefine vehicle types, capacities, and counts during setup
   - Set default pickup/dropoff locations

2. **Guest Allocation Logic:**
   - Maintain family grouping logic
   - Match guests to appropriate predefined vehicles based on:
     - Family size
     - Arrival times
     - Special requirements
   - Present matches as drafts for approval

3. **UI Changes:**
   - Replace "Transport Groups" page with "Transport Assignments"
   - Show available fleet with allocation status
   - Allow manual adjustments to auto-generated assignments
   - Maintain family cohesion in UI presentation

## Data Model Updates

Several schema updates will be required:

1. **New Tables:**
   - `event_setup_progress` - Track completion status of wizard sections
   - `transport_fleet` - Define available vehicle types and counts
   - `transport_options` - Store predefined transport templates

2. **Modifications:**
   - Update `transport_groups` to reference fleet vehicles
   - Add progress tracking fields to `events` table
   - Link accommodation types to wizard-defined templates

## Migration Strategy

To preserve existing data while implementing the wizard:

1. Create migration scripts for each module
2. Populate wizard defaults from existing configurations
3. Update references in existing data to new wizard-defined options
4. Provide UI indicators for items needing review after migration

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Wizard Framework | 1-2 weeks |
| 2 | Data Integration | 1-2 weeks |
| 3 | Feature Refactoring | 2-3 weeks |
| 4 | UI/UX Streamlining | 1 week |
| | **Total** | **5-8 weeks** |

## Success Criteria

The wizard implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All setup functions are accessible through the wizard
2. Existing data is preserved and properly connected
3. Users can navigate seamlessly between wizard and management interfaces
4. Setup process requires fewer clicks and less context switching
5. Management functions properly utilize wizard-defined parameters
