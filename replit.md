## Changelog

Changelog:

- July 2, 2025. Complete rewrite of Hotel & Accommodation step (Step 4) with full functionality:
  - Added working "Add Hotel" and "Add Room Type" buttons
  - Implemented comprehensive hotel management with CRUD operations
  - Added form validation, edit/delete capabilities, and toast notifications
  - Integrated proper accommodation modes (Block Booking, Direct Booking)
  - Added auto-allocation and guest preference settings
  - Connected to accommodation management across the application
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved hotel persistence issue where hotels disappeared after save
  - Fixed query invalidation system for proper data refresh after wizard step saves
  - Ensured complete database integration with proper hotels and room types persistence
- July 2, 2025. Transport coordination system architecture completed:
  - **ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION**: Event setup wizard is for configuration only; operational transport coordination is a separate module used post-setup
  - Created comprehensive transport coordination database infrastructure (transport_vendors, location_representatives, event_vehicles, guest_travel_info tables)
  - Implemented complete transport API routes with CRUD operations for vendors, representatives, and vehicles
  - Completely rewrote transport wizard step to focus on setup configuration rather than operational management
  - Transport step now handles transport modes, flight coordination, provider details, and guest instructions
  - Operational transport coordination interface (as shown in Travel Management module) will be separate from wizard
- July 2, 2025. Flight coordination architecture implemented:
  - Added comprehensive Flight Assistance Mode section to transport setup wizard
  - Flight coordination workflow: List collection → Export to travel agents → Import flight details → Guest communication
  - Flight modes: None, Guidance only, List collection for travel agent, Full coordination service
  - Integration points with RSVP module: Guests indicate flight needs during RSVP Stage 2
  - Email module integration: Automated flight confirmations and travel updates based on coordination mode
  - **IMPORTANT**: No in-app flight booking (requires IATA approval) - system only handles coordination and data management
- July 2, 2025. **CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: Transport data persistence issue resolved through comprehensive code review:
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Type mismatch in eventId handling - session eventId could be string, database expected number
  - **SYMPTOM**: WHERE clause in database update silently failed, causing no rows to be updated
  - **DEBUGGING REVEALED**: Backend correctly received 'selected' mode, but database still showed 'none'
  - **SOLUTION**: Added proper type conversion in transport endpoint: `parseInt(rawEventId, 10)` with validation
  - **VERIFICATION**: Added comprehensive database update debugging with immediate post-update verification
  - **STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Transport data persistence working perfectly
  - **VERIFICATION**: Database debugging confirms transport_mode: 'selected' properly saved and retrieved
  - User frustration resolved through systematic root cause analysis instead of multiple failed attempts
  - Transport step now fully functional with proper data persistence across all operations
- July 2, 2025. **COMPREHENSIVE MODULE INTEGRATION ANALYSIS COMPLETED**:
